# Introduction

## Introduction

## 🚀 StockTok 📈

Hey Albert team! 👋 Here is my take on a trendy real-time securities watchlist? 🧦💨

### Tok to me about it! 🐝

I've crafted a stock watchlist service that's so smooth, it makes butter jealous. 🧈 Millions of users? Each with their own personalized watchlists? Updating in real-time every 5 seconds? It's better than having that weird Superman crystal device that you see in his ice mansion briefly in the movie in your pocket! 🔮📱

### How? 🎩✨

1. **Scalability**: Somwthin somethin...
2. **Real-time**: Somwthin somethin...
3. **Some other thing**: Somwthin somethin...

### Want to peek under the hood? 🔧🔍

Check out these docs for the in-depth details:

* [Technical Overview](technical-overview.md): The blueprints.
* [Database Schema](database-schema.md): Where data goes to party.
* [API Documentation](api-documentation.md): The secret handshake \[some silly icon HERE?].
* [Future Considerations](future-considerations.md): I dream big!

### Ready to take it for a spin? 🎡

1. Clone this repo faster than a falling stock price.
2. Run `make init` to assemble your rocket ship.
3. Profit.

### The cherry on top 🍒

This project was built with love. Also, was SUPER fun to build - i've been meaning to learn Python for at least 15 years now. Perfect opportunity!
