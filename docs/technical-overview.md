# Technical Overview

## Planning Phase

### Project Analysis and Component Breakdown

1. Backend Service (Django):
   - User Authentication and Management
   - Stock Data Management
   - Watchlist Management
   - Real-time Price Updates
   - API Layer for Frontend

2. Frontend App (React):
   - User Interface for Login/Logout (Provided by Albert)
   - Stock Search Functionality
   - Watchlist Display and Management
   - Real-time Price Updates Display

3. Database Design:
   - User Model (already provided)
   - Security Model (partially implemented)
   - Watchlist Model (to be implemented)
   - Indexing Strategy for efficient queries

4. External API Integration:
   - Stock Ticker Retrieval (Read the docs from Albert!)
   - Real-time Price Updates (Read the docs from Albert!)

5. Caching and Performance Optimization:
   - Redis Integration (already set up in settings.py)

Key Decisions to Make:

1. Real-time Updates Strategy:
   - Options: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, Polling
   - Decision factors: Scalability, resource usage, client support

2. Stock Data Caching Strategy:
   - Need to efficiently cache and update stock data for millions of users
   - Need to balancing between API call limits and data fresh-y-ness

3. Database Schema Design:
   - How to structure the Watchlist model
   - Indexing strategy for efficient queries

4. API Design:
   - RESTful vs GraphQL
   - Endpoint structure for watchlist operations

5. Authentication and Authorization:
   - Token-based? Session-based?
   - Implementing proper user authorization for watchlist access

6. Scalability Approach:
   - Horizontal vs Vertical scaling strategies
   - Load balancing

7. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Implementing robust error handling
   - Setting up comprehensive logging for observability

8. Testing Strategy:
   - Unit testing, integration testing
   - Test coverage goals?

9. Frontend State Management:
   - Choice of state management library (e.g., Redux, MobX, or React Context)

10. Deployment and DevOps:
    - Kubernetes? Overkill? Fun?
    - CI/CD pipeline setup (Setup CircleCI?)

## Implementation Phase

1. Implement models and schema
2. Implement basic CRUD operations for watchlists.
3. Set up the external API integration for fetching stock data.
4. Implement a basic real-time update mechanism.
5. Create the frontend components for watchlist management.
6. Implement user authentication and authorization.

## If this was real, we would do this...

- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Add more stuff later
